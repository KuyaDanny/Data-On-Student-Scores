# Overview

What I was trying to do with this little project was to see how I could implement graphs into a set of data and use that data to solve certain questions I had for this set of data as well

The data I got from kaggle.com was of exam scores of students. It had a lot of information that contributes to the student's exam scores.
Which include whether they completed the preparation material for the exam to even if their parents had college level education to see if that would possibly contribute to them having an advantage over other students.
I got that data from this link here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/students-performance-in-exams?resource=download

# Data Analysis Results

I wanted to be able to figure out if some students have a natural advantage over others if their parents attained higher education. If that proved true
I also wanted to see if personal efforts like completing the prep material also contributed to them doing better than the other students.
What I found was that there was a improvement in both sides. With the parent education showing that as a parent's education was higher their child's grades also improved slightly. With the preparation comparison there was a little difference in the average score being 5 points higher for a student that completed the work compared to one that didn't.
# Development Environment

To make this program work I utilized that data I got from kaggle and implemented python pandas and along with it I imported seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot so that I would be able to develop the visual graphs as well.

# Future Work
I want to be able to scroll through my different graphs since at the moment in order for me to get to the next graph I have to exit out of the current one and if I want to go back I have to re run the program.
